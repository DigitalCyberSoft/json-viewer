![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DigitalCyberSoft/json-viewer/master/screenshot.png)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

This is a community fork of the JSON Viewer extension. The original extension was unfortunately sold to a malicious actor who used it to compromise developer browsers. This fork was created to provide a safe, open-source alternative for developers who need JSON viewing capabilities without security risks.

**This version:**
- Has been updated to use Chrome's Manifest V3 for enhanced security
- Contains no tracking or malicious code
- Is fully open source and auditable
- Will remain community-maintained

## About

The most beautiful and customizable JSON/JSONP highlighter that your eyes have ever seen. It is a Chrome extension for printing JSON and JSONP.

Notes:

* This extension might crash with other JSON highlighters/formatters, you may need to disable them
* To highlight local files and incognito tabs you have to manually enable these options on the extensions page
* Sometimes when the plugin updates chrome leaves the old background process running and revokes some options, like the access to local files. When this happen just recheck the option that everything will work again
